Build and a Docker image with Cloud Build and Push to an Artifact Registry repo from a local directory with Dockerfile
https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-push-docker-image

Then deploy a web service from an image in the Artifact Registry
https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts?_ga=2.3436592.-1854877041.1681099032#deploy-a-prebuilt-container

Do them both in one step with Dockerfile or buildpack! (note: some permissions may need to be enabled first)
https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service
$ gcloud run deploy
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy
If a Dockerfile is present in the source code directory, it will be built using that Dockerfile, otherwise it will use Google Cloud buildpacks.
